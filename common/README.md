# Purpose
Store the 'common' parts of all of the sub-projects:
1. headers that define the common interface for these parts;
2. source files for defining the behaviour of said parts;
3. object files to be compiled into the executable of each sub-project, for providing the said parts.

Those common parts are as follows:
- 'cpx_op': defines the needed complex number operations;
- 'fft_prep_bit': the 

The next technologies are used:
- GCC version 

Provide the source code and headers needed for obtaining the object files that will be linked into the sub-projects of
