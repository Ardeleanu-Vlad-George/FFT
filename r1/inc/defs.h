/**

  * \brief Just define some constants that the whole program needs
    Define the following constants:
    - PI    - the value of the constant pi
    - SIGN  - it influences what kind of definition is used for the
    first root of unity, which influences the order in which the 
    roots appear
    - TARGET_VALUE - the value that will be achieved for Nyquist after
    the logarithmic normalization
